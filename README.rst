FreeCodeCamp Personal Portfolio Website
=====================================

In this projects, I was given the task to create a personal portfolio website demonstrating my front-end skills and experience as a web developer.
It was recommended that we use a safe and easy front-end language for building this website, but I decided to showcase my skill as a web developer and used ReactJS.


The **Objective** for this project: Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: `CodePen <https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/zNBOYG>`_.

A FreeCodeCamp Personal Portfolio Project of the Responsive Web Design Curriculum. Visit FreeCodeCamp_ for more details.
